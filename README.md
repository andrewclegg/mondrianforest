mondrianforest
==============

This is a reimplementation of Mondrian Forests as described here:

**Mondrian Forests: Efficient Online Random Forests**

Balaji Lakshminarayanan, Daniel M. Roy, Yee Whye Teh

http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2673

It partly uses code from the original authors' implementation at

https://github.com/balajiln/mondrianforest

but changes a few things along the way too.

See the [experiment-1.ipynb](IPython Notebook) for more info.

This is **very much** work in progress.
